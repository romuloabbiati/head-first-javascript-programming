A)
// Test for jokes
var joke = "JavaScript walked into a bar...'; // it should be consistent
// if it starts with double quotes, finish with double quotes or 
// vice-versa

var toldJoke = "false"; // a boolean value should not be embedded in 
// double quotes

var $spushline = "Better watch out for those semi-colons." 
// it should be consistent, if decided to use semi-colon in one line, 
all lines should have one or vice-versa

var %entage = 20; // bad practice to start a variable name with %

var result // a value should be assigned to the variable result

B)
// Movie Night
var zip code = 98104; // variable naming convention not allows a white
// space. It should use camel case convention

var joe'sFavoriteMovie = Forbidden Planet; // according to variable 
// naming convention it should not have special characters like single 
// quotes. Also a string should be embedded in a double quotes

var movieTicket$ = 9; // it should have only one white space between words
