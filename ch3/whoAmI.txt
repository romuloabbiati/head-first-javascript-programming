A bunch of JS attendees, in full costume, are playing a party game, "Who 
am I?". They give you a clue, and you try to guess who they are, based on 
what they say. Assume they always tell the truth about themselves. Fill in 
the blank next to each sentence with the name of one attendee.

Tonight's attendees:
function, argument, return, scope, local variable, global variable, 
pass-by-value, parameter, function call, Math.random, built-in functions, 
code reuse.


I get passed in to a function -> argument 

I send values back to the calling code -> return

I'm the all important keyword -> function

I'm what receives arguments -> parameter

It really means 'make a copy' -> pass-by-value

I'm everywhere -> global variable 

Another phrase for invoking a function -> function call 

Example of a function attached to an object -> Math.random 

alert and prompt are examples -> built-in functions

What functions are great for -> code reuse

Where I can be seen -> scope

I'm around when my functions is -> local variable
