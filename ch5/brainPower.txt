BRAIN POWER

If you copy the start, stop and drive methods into the chevy and cadi 
objects we created earlier, what do you have to change to make the methods 
work correctly?

Nothing! Because the this keyword refers to the object that holds that 
particular method. If you call cadi.start(), it will run the start() 
method based on the cadi properties/attributes, etc
